# Word-Guess-Game

Another classic kids game but with an out of this world twist (*cough* it's space themed *cough*).

The challenge in this game was using JavaScript to append letters and keep track of previously used letters and well as a scoreboard systen in which it keeps track of how many wins and losses occured. This was one of my first opportunities with JavaScript so it was a fun experience having to research and find clever ways to arrange everything in the JS file.

This is Hangman in space. 

The way it works is simple.

Load the page and you will see a couple things appear, 

Firstly the middle of the page will be the empty hangman stand.
To the left will be an area to house all of the incorrect letters you might guess as well as a counter for how many tries you have left.
To the right will be a score board for how many wins or losses you have acquired while playing.
And lastly you will see text saying "press any key to start".

When you enter a key the game will start. 
It will then replace the "press any key to start" text with blank underlines indicating a mystery word you will have to guess.
Type in any letter you like and if you get one correct it will fill in the blank underline it belongs to.
Get it wrong and it will add that letter to the list of incorrect letters, decrease your tries left counter, and also add a part of the alien to the hangman stand.

If you get all of the letter correct before running out of tries you will get 1 point added to your win counter.
If you do not get all of the letters you will get 1 point added to the losses counter.

This game was fun to make, I hope you enjoy it!!!
